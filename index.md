## Introduction ##

An introduction to provide users of Spine2 with the information required to utilise the service.

### Spine2 Roadmap ###

For all new Spine2 interfaces short implementation guides are being created which contain the majority of information a consuming system will require to utilise the service.

At this time the follow implementation guides are available:

- Spine Mini Services 1.2  (itk_smsp_0.1.0_20140724000001<sup>1</sup>)
- MESH API 
- SSP API 
- EPS Prescription Tracker
- Record Locator Service API
- FGM Implimentation Guide

In some areas this guide refers out to the formal “External Interface Specification” (EIS) document originally from the Spine1 programme. Currently the latest version of the EIS is 12.2 . For new interfaces introduced since August 2014 the EIS is not required. However, for those wishing to utilise historic services which have not yet been refreshed (such as EPS or SCR retrievals) communications based on the EIS will be required. 

<sup>1</sup>This is a previously existing ITK specification describing the SMSP interface which Spine2 has implimented.
