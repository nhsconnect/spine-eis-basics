## Locating and Connecting To Spine ##

### Certificates ### 

In order to connect to Spine services you will need to obtain a Spine certificate. Typically this forms part of a registration process on the Endpoint Registration System. For the purposes of a connectathon you will be provided with temporary certificates. The certificate allows messages to be secured using TLS. (More information about this can be found in Part 6 of the EIS, section 6.12.5)

### Locating the Spine URL ### 

Once you have a certificate installed you will typically need to ratify the URL of a spine service. Spine service URLs are defined in the ??? document.

Once you have established the URL for a service there are a number of different interfaces that you may need to use to access and update data on the Spine. The Spine2 service supports all of the original messaging interfaces from Spine1 as well as an increasing number of new, simpler services interfaces.
